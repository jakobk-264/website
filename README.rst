Purpose
========

This is a project to start hosting my personal website.

* Primarily, this project is for my personal learning, to apply different
  python and webapp concepts. 
* Secondarily, this project will serve for me to publish different material in
  the data science and risk management space, again to help me with my personal
  learning.
* And finally, maybe some of this material will be helpful to others!
